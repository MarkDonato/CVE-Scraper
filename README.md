# CVE-scraper

## What is it
CVE-Scraper is an application designed to take CVE data from different sources, compound the data from these sources, and create a larger (and your very own!) aggregate database from these sites.

## Current State
Not much work has been put into this yet, it is just a proof of concept and a learning route for myself. That being said, the code runs, and I will not purposefully commit modifications that change that fact.

This has only been tested on Windows 10 so far. 

## How to run it
Run Main.py with python 3

## Requirements
python 3
Beautiful Soup
SQLITE3

## Goals Checklist
[COMPLETE] Scrape cvedetails.com-still ironing out a few bugs or course\
[NOT STARTED] Scrape exploit-db.com\
[NOT STARTED] Scrape reddit\
[NOT STARTED] Pull from Github's api to find any projects related to a CVE\
[STARTED] personal database creation\
[NOT STARTED] use known database data to detect when new vulnerabilities are announced and if they meet certain criteria, notify the recipient/user/duck

## DISCLAIMER
No harm was intended for the websites that data is being pulled from, I purposefully did not thread the scraper so that it would not hit any of the websites too hard. I have examined each sites' `robots.txt` file as well. That being said, if the owners of any of the targeted sites would like for me to remove their site's scraping I will be happy to do so.
