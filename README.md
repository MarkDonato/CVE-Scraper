# CVE-scraper

## What is it
CVE-Scraper is an application designed to take CVE data from different sources, compound the data from these sources, and create a larger (and your very own!) aggregate database from these sites.

## Goals Checklist
[COMPLETE] Scrape cvedetails.com \
[NOT STARTED] Scrape exploit-db.com\
[NOT STARTED] Scrape reddit\
[NOT STARTED] personal database creation

## Current State
Not much work has been put into this yet, it is just a proof of concept and a learning route for myself. That being said, the code runs, and I will not purposefully commit modifications that change that fact.

## How to run it
Run Main.py with python 3

## DISCLAIMER
No harm was intended for the websites that data is being pulled from, I purposefully did not thread the scraper so that it would not hit any of the websites too hard. That being said, if the owners of any of the targeted sites would like for me to remove their site's scraping I will be happy to do so.
